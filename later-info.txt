once you open it in Godot later:
    player.tscn = A scene that uses your two scripts:
    sprite_design.gd for how it looks (which image to use)
    sprite_movement.gd for how it moves (keyboard controls, jumping)
    background.tscn = A scene that uses background.gd to show your level’s background image.
    main.tscn = The “main room” that puts it all together:
    Adds your background.
    Adds your player.
    Runs the game.
